Nowadays, <strong>I am Embedded Systems Coordinator<strong> in a startup called Antares Aerospace where we develop technology in different industries focusing on the development of the space sector in Mexico and the LATAM Region. Also, <strong>I am working as a consultor in topics like implementing technology and digitalization<strong> in different levels for small and medium-sized enterprises. Last but not least, as you can see, <strong>now I am improving my skills in software development<strong> since I have learned all about embedded systems, electronic and mechanical design and why not, now start to improve my skills in software development.

## Relevant Embedded Systems Projects üë®‚Äçüíª
### Semiautonomous Wheelchair for Assistance Support in Rehabilitation Centers ü¶º
<p align="justify">
Degree project in which I was in charge of the complete mechanical design and CAD modeling in Solidworks of the different conduction systems, energy, postural reconfiguration of the patient and information processing. Added to this I developed a high fidelity prototype of a mobile application called Fisio Smart that has as end user the physical therapist so that the chair is a technological support that quantifies the rehabilitation process of the patient and thus also support the physical therapist in the physical rehabilitation process of their patients using the VDI-2206 methodologies for the development of mechatronic projects and Design Thinking for the mobile application.
